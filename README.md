this is just for fun

here i will put some vanilla JS stuff to practise pure JS and enhance my skillset on it and see result of it on the internet through this website, i want develop stuff here as GPT help me create like: calculator, simple to do, memory game, currency converter, data visualization, authentication system,... something like this, it will be simple, 100% focus on coding, not styling stuff here.
